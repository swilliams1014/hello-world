# hello-world
This is my first repository, I do have a BSEE, I received that in 1993 and only spent 2 years designing, back in those days we had to learn Pascal, Fortran and all the "oldies", I moved goth dark side (sale) in 1995 and have been selling large network systems to Eneterprise accounts thought TX.  However my inner geek still lives on I was out of work for several months and spent that time already had jailbreak my iOS devices and have now gotten a little bit deeper into it and just wanted to check things out.
